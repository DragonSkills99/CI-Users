If you want to read the documentation, you have to download and open it in your preferred browser. Or [let it preview](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DragonSkills99/CI-Users/blob/master/Documentation/GettingStarted.html). After opening the preview and not the downloaded page, click on the cat icons to switch between the pages use the normal links for switching the pages in the downloaded version.
